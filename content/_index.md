👋 Hi, I'm **Khushi Tripathi** — a Data Engineer with 2+ years of experience designing scalable pipelines, building NLP models, and surviving AWS nightmares.  

I specialize in Python, PySpark, and SQL—turning chaos into clean, intelligent data solutions. From Spark to Snowflake, I’ve built analytics infrastructure that empowers teams, improves decision-making, and sometimes even works on the first try.  

I'm passionate about NLP, predictive analytics, data visualization, and not debugging things for 6 hours.

🎓 M.S. in Data Science, University at Buffalo  
📍 Based in New York  
💬 Fluent in data, Python, and sarcasm
